        <!-- 2.1 image tag, which too is inline, is a bit different as you can give height and width,
        you can also work with padding and marging etc. -->

    <!-- 3. Inline_Block Element is used when we want our elements to be inline but also be able
    to use properties that cannot be used on inline, such as padding, marging and controlling height
    and width etc. It is achieved by using display attribute in css ex: display: inline-block; -->
